# unit2_project
James Martinez's Unit 2 Project, SEIR-MAE


## Task at hand:

Most of the routes are functional.

The next step is about organizing tracks -- being able to sort them on the index page
- by Genre (default)
- by Artist
- by Source
- Alphabetical by Title
- by upload date

## Next Step

- index page interface
    - what sort of buttons will lead the user to the edit/delete/view pages?
- storing masterlists of Artist, Genre, and Source as separate databases

## Would be nice:

- find a way to grey out certain parts of the New/Edit menus when they become unavailable
